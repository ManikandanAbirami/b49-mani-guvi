Copy by Value:

1. All the primitive data types in JavaScript are Copy by Value.(string, number, boolean)
2. Changing the value of a variable never changes the underlying primitive variable, 
    it just points to new memory location.

Copy by Reference:

1. All the nom - primitive data types in JavaScript are Copy by Ref.(Object, Arrays)
2. Changing the value of a variable changes the value underlying primitive variable, 
    it points to same memory location.

Hoisting:

All the variables and functions whixh are declared globally are
moved at the top and remembered by the compiler.

Scope:

It provides code security and helps to debug code faster and 
more efficiently.

Local: Anything inside a function is in its local scope.
Global: Anything not inside any function is in its global scope
